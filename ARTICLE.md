# The Hardest Part of Building Software: Requirements

I recently read an insightful article titled "[The hardest part of building software is not coding, it's requirements](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/29/the-hardest-part-of-building-software-is-not-coding-its-requirements/)" on the Stack Overflow blog. The author emphasizes that while coding can be challenging, defining clear and accurate requirements is often the most difficult aspect of software development. This resonated with me because it highlights the importance of understanding the problem domain and effectively communicating with stakeholders to ensure that the software built truly meets users' needs.

The article also discusses how miscommunication and misunderstandings during the requirements phase can lead to significant issues later in the development process. It serves as a reminder that investing time and effort into gathering and refining requirements can prevent costly rework and ensure a more successful project outcome.

<p>I found this article to be very interesting. In particular, it was a relief reading about the author's opinion on AI replacing software engineers. I liked that he differentiated software and code, and then explained that while AI can create code, it can not create software. I thought this article was very refreshingand I highly enjoyed reading it.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is the comparison of AI in chess versus self-driving cars, emphasizing that while AI excels in rule-based environments, it struggles with the complexity and unpredictability of real-world scenariosâ€”just like software development.</p>
